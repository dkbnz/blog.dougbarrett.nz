## Doug's Blog

[![Deployment status.](https://github.com/dkbarrett/blog.dougbarrett.nz/workflows/Deployment/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dkbarrett/blog.dougbarrett.nz/actions?query=workflow%3ADeployment)

This is the code for my blog. Feel free to check it out at

### Workflow

The site is built using a static site generator called [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted via [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

Due to GitHub limiting the plugins in jekyll, I have implemented an actions workflow to circumvent these restrictions.
